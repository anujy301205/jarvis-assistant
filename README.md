Jarvis – AI Desktop Voice Assistant for Windows

Jarvis is a fully featured voice-controlled AI assistant built in Python.
It automates Windows tasks, controls apps, retrieves information, runs a local AI model for chat, and speaks back using natural TTS.
Designed to work like a personal desktop J.A.R.V.I.S but practical and real.
